"""
Make code which enters expression like '3525 + 133 =' and solve it. Easy right? Here is the catch is that numbers and operations are replaced by their words equivalents.
Please support numbers up to 1 000 000 and these operators + â€“ * /
Example:
    input: 'three thousands five hundreds and twenty five plus one hundred and thirty three is equal to'
    output: 3658
